I will crosspost the technical articles for a while, but in the future I intend to post mainly at https://tnorlin.se as it's hard to justify to keep paying for multiple domains just for fun. With a domain name such as kubernaut, it doesn't really make sense to post about other matters than kubernetes (and I do have plenty of interests, the biggest hurdle is time and money). During the migration of articles to the other repository, and trying to build up individual RSS feeds, I found out that I had misunderstood the concept of content collections in Astro. Hopefully I've got it by now as the layout seem to behave as planned.
