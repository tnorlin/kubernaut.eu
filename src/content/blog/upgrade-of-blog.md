One of the strenghts with a free blog platform is also what, at times, can become a burden. I tested out astro at v2 and a couple of months later, the project was already at v4. Also, I chosed a template, AstroPaper, as styling. As I wanted to have content collections (content organised by type), the project had to be adapted for that so the update was not seamless and I decided to install the versions in a new tree and then my strategy was an aggressive rebase of everything, hopefully it all ended well.
