A while ago I got a question if I had any demo of my concept running an illumos based Control Plane but I only had a asciinema clip to show, but now I went the tough route to attempt make a demo in English. My first attempt ended up perfect, with just the tiny detail â€” OBS decided to freeze my desktop screen capture. Something I found out about 21 minutes later.

A new attempt with some troubleshooting, but it ended well, no packets was harmed during the filming. :-)
