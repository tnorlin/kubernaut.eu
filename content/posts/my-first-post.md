## Is Hugo a good Medium alternative?

I've tried out Medium (https://medium.com/@norlin.t) as a way to share my ideas and experiences, but I'm really not convinced on it being the perfect platform for me. I don't write to earn money (or fame) and that site doesn't let me share articles freely to anonymous guests. All those paywalls.. 

What I do like with Medium is its CMS with a rather good editor, complete with a styling and it is also possible to publish stories that reach an audience (and have stats that shows if there is an audience at all to begin with). Publishing a GH hosted Hugo blog is another thing, and that's why I've been torn about what direction I should take.

Is there another great platform or should I perhaps just cross post?
