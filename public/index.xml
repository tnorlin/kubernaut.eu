      <description>Is Hugo a good Medium alternative? I&amp;rsquo;ve tried out Medium (https://medium.com/@norlin.t) as a way to share my ideas and experiences, but I&amp;rsquo;m really not convinced on it being the perfect platform for me. I don&amp;rsquo;t write to earn money (or fame) and that site doesn&amp;rsquo;t let me share articles freely to anonymous guests. All those paywalls..
What I do like with Medium is its CMS with a rather good editor, complete with a styling and it is also possible to publish stories that reach an audience (and have stats that shows if there is an audience at all to begin with).</description>
